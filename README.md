The code and files within this repository are currently a work in progress and as such I cannot ensure that all the code
provided will be in a usable form as I can only work on it during my free time. Additionally, I used Ryan Mirch's hexapod
code to assist logic and structure within my code. Ryan's Repo: https://github.com/Ryan-Mirch/Aecerts_Hexapod_V1/tree/main/Hexapod_Code
